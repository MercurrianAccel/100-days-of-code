# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 23 December 2019 (Preperations Underway...)

**Today's Progress**: Read up on some rules, strategies and anecdotes from others taking the challenge.

**Thoughts:** Somehow, even just getting started with the challenge was in itself a trial because I didn't know where, how or even what to start and what I want to aim for at the end of this challenge. I also wasn't sure if it was alright for me to just log my progress on FreeCodeCamp on here, but after a bit of reading, I suppose it'd be alright.

At the moment, I'm doing Applied Visual Design. My programming skills in general are rusty, and I happen to hold some interest in web design, so studying some more CSS is fine by me.

### Day 1: 25 December 2019 (Applied Visual Design on FCC)

**Today's Progress**: Made progress in freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design course.

**Thoughts**: Tried out taking notes with Anki for the in-depth explanations on each challenge. It certainly slowed down my progress AT THE MOMENT, but it'd be handy for recalling key concepts later on. If supplementing fCC with Anki proves inefficiient, however, then I'll leave that alone for the time being.

CSS is an interesting language, and so is its implementations. I look forward to making more progress tomorrow.

### Day 2: 26 December 2019 (Applied Visual Design on FCC)

**Today's Progress**: Made progress in freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design course. [WIP]

**Thoughts**: Just one day after starting may be too early to tell, but I think Anki helped me with recaling certain concpets from the past day of coding.
