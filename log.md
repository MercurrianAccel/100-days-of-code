**Today's Progress**: Read up on some rules, strategies and anecdotes from others taking the challenge.

**Thoughts:** Somehow, even just getting started with the challenge was in itself a trial because I didn't know where, how or even what to start and what I want to aim for at the end of this challenge. I also wasn't sure if it was alright for me to just log my progress on FreeCodeCamp on here, but after a bit of reading, I suppose it'd be alright.

At the moment, I'm doing Applied Visual Design. My programming skills in general are rusty, and I happen to hold some interest in web design, so studying some more CSS is fine by me.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
